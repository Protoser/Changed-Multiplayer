# How To Run Game/Server

## Setup
In the folder you will find 2 .txt files. (id.txt and ip.txt)

The id.txt is the id, every player should have their own ID (unless you want bugs ^w^). (Numbers only)

In the ip.txt file you put the ip of the server you're connecting to. ([localhost / ip of server]:6969)

## Starting Server
To start the server, run the file with the name "server.bat". (Only host, not 2nd player)

You have to have java installed on your system.

The server should now start and run on your machine. (all computing devices with JAVA)

The server automatically runs on port 6969 so you have to open the port on your router.

## Starting Game
To start/run the game you need the game in steam and have steam running. (not game from steam)
After starting steam you can run the file with the name "Game.exe", this will launch the game on your device. (Windows only)
