# How To Run Game/Server

## Setup
Download the .zip files of the repository and extract files. Then replace all the files in your changed game folder from steam with those you downloaded. 

In the Utils folder you will find 2 .txt files. (id.txt and ip.txt)

The id.txt is the id, every player should have their own ID (unless you want bugs ^w^). (Numbers only)

In the ip.txt file you put the ip of the server you're connecting to. ([localhost / ip of server]:6969)

## Starting Server (first)

To start the server on Windows, run the file with the name "server.bat". (Only host, not 2nd player)

You have to have java installed on your system.

The server should now start and run on your machine.

The server automatically runs on port 6969 so you have to open the port (tcp) on your router.

## Starting Game
Now with the server up and running you can go into steam and lauch changed. If you have no previous saves you cannot join a game so quickly go into the main menu and create a new game.
