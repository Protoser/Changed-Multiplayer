# ChangedMP (WIP)

## You Need The Game On Steam To Play This Version.

Why did we do this? To prevent piracy of the game.

# Functionality

In this version you can play with a second player (Only 2)! The movements are synced so you see what the other player is doing. You have your own saves and own progress. This could therefore be made for a challange to see who can make it through a level or the whole game the fastest. We are still working on syncing events so that lets say a player triggers something the other player experiences the consequences as well.

# How To Run Game/Server

## Setup
Download the .zip files of the repository and extract files. Then replace all the files in your changed game folder from steam with those you downloaded. 

In the Utils folder you will find a ip.txt file.

In the ip.txt file you put the ip of the server you're connecting to. ([localhost / ip of server]:6969)

## Starting Server (first)

To start the server on Windows, run the file with the name "server.bat". (Only host, not 2nd player)

You have to have java installed on your system.

The server should now start and run on your machine.

The server automatically runs on port 6969 so you have to open the port (tcp) on your router.

## Starting Game
Now with the server up and running you can go into steam and lauch changed. If you have no previous saves you cannot join a game so quickly go into the main menu and create a new game. 

# Uninstall
To uninstall the game just go to steam and verify the game files of changed
